    <hr id='top-line'>
    <h3> Kate Rabinowitz // March 17, 2017 // as featured in Washingtonian</h3>
    <p class="content">Despite a cold snap and and a snowstorm that will likely result in a <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2017/03/17/things-are-not-looking-good-for-the-cherry-blossoms-after-the-snow/" class="link" target="_blank">greatly diminished peak-bloom period</a>, the National Cherry Blossom Festival is still on. And that means it’s time for the return of one of Capital Bikeshare most popular promotions: the <a href="https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/blog/spot-the-bike-in-bloom" class="link" target="_blank">#BikeinBloom</a>, in which the system adds a single pink bike to its fleet of nearly 4,000. For four weeks, the pink bike is released into the Capital Bikeshare system—which spans DC, Arlington, Alexandria, Fairfax County, and Montgomery County—for riders to find, ride, and photograph. 
    <br><br>
    But spotting a single bike among the entire network sounds daunting. Looking back at the bike’s movements during 2016’s Cherry Blossom Festival might provide some insight for Capital Bikeshare users hoping to find this year’s model.
    <br><br>
    The pink bike was the most popular vehicle in Capital Bikeshare’s system for the four weeks it was available last year. In 2016, the bike was used 220 times, compared to a fleet-wide average of 77 uses in the same period. But that doesn’t mean the bike in bloom was especially well-traveled. Despite its constant ridership, the pink bike only made to just over a quarter of the nearly 400 stations Capital Bikeshare had at the time. Not surprisingly, it was parked most frequently at docks along the National Mall or other tourist destinations, as shown in the map below. <a href='./bikeinBloom.html' class="link" target="_blank">Read on...</a></p></p>

These new District residents have undeniably changed the demographic makeup of D.C., which on the whole has become whiter, wealthier, and younger over the past decade.<br><br>
    However, these changes have not happened consistently across all parts of the District. We can see where these trends have been most pronounced when we look at data from individual neighborhoods “clusters” (group of neighborhoods that are frequently used for data analysis and planning purposes). The maps below show changes in race, wealth, and age by neighborhood cluster between two five-year spans, from 2006-2011 and from 2011-2015. <a href='./decadeChange.html' class="link" target="_blank">Read on...</a></p>

    <p class="content">DC is often cited as the <a href="http://tech.co/dc-is-the-top-city-for-women-in-tech-2016-02" class="link" target="_blank">#1 place for women in tech</a>, but you wouldn’t know it by attending some of the area’s biggest tech meetups. The region has an active tech and data meetup community that hosts professional events. They can be great places to learn, network, and job search. Unfortunately, these events rarely reflect the industry’s diversity in DC, and that can have far-reaching effects. Taken back by the speaker gap the data revealed, I’ve also created <a class="link" target=_"blank" href="http://wespeaktoo.org/">wespeaktoo.org</a> to help promote women speakers.  
    <br><br>
    I looked at the gender diversity of speakers at 114 events in 2016 from 16 DC area meetups. These meetups were selected because they had over 1,000 members and typically held educational events featuring a single or few speakers. The results were startling. In 2016, there were no single-speaker events where a woman was the speaker. <a class="link" target="_blank" href='meetupSpeakers.html'>Read on...</a></p>

    <h3> Kate Rabinowitz // August 31, 2016 // as featured in Greater Greater Washington</h3>
    <p class="content">Earlier this month, a map saying that $100 will buy you less in DC than any other state made the online rounds. But while it's true $100 will buy you less in DC, it's misleading to leave it at that because DC's higher incomes mean it's easier to make $100 here than in many other places.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="./Images/value100state.png" width="100%" height=auto style="max-width:500px;"></p>

    <p class="content">The above map, which came from the <a target="_blank" class="link" href="http://taxfoundation.org/blog/real-value-100-each-state-2016">Tax Foundation's Alan Cole</a> uses the relative value of $100 across states to highlight how prices of the same goods vary. "The same amount of cash can buy you comparatively more in a low-price state than in a high-price state," writes Cole. For instance, in Mississippi, the state with the lowest prices, you could spend $100 to buy goods that would on average cost $115.34 in the US. Conversely, DC has the lowest relative value of $100: If you spend $100 in DC you would receive goods that on average cost $84.67.</p>

    <h3> Kate Rabinowitz // August 1, 2016  // as featured in Greater Greater Washington</h3>
    <p class="content">While all of DC is a city, some of its residential neighborhoods feel more like a city than others. This feels intuitive walking along the smaller row houses of Capitol Hill compared to the more expansive mid-century homes in upper Northwest.<br><br>

    The maps below show this divide between homes in the inner and outer sections of the city by house type, year built, and lot size. Generally, homes located closer to the city core are older, built upon smaller lots, and almost entirely row houses. There is a strong interrelatedness between these three housing characteristics that can be seen by the almost identical areas of light shading across the maps. The area extends from Capitol Hill to Georgetown and from Shaw up to Petworth. Conversely homes outside of these neighborhoods tend to have been built later, on larger lots, and more likely to be single (self-standing) or semi-detached homes.<a href='./dcHomeChars.html' class="link" target="_blank"> Read on...</a></p>

    <hr id='top-line'>
    <h3> Kate Rabinowitz // May 11, 2016 // as featured in Washingtonian</h3>
    <p class="content">There’s a long-held debate around Washington over which jurisdiction is home to the worst drivers. With jobs in DC split about evenly between the city and the suburbs, the District sees drivers from all over put to the test with its one-way streets, traffic circles, back-in-only spaces, and parallel parking. What insight can open data provide into the prowess of the region’s drivers? Newly released parking-ticket data sheds some light. 
    <br><br>The District issued more than 1.5 million parking tickets in 2015, generating more than $73 million in fines. While DC residents received a little less than one-third of the tickets, they were not actually the top recipients. That honor goes to motorists from Maryland, who accrued more DC parking tickets than drivers from anywhere else in the country. Maryland drivers received 120,000 more DC parking tickets than DC residents, for a total of 554,265 parking tickets worth over $25 million in fines. The trend is consistent with previous years and, perhaps more importantly, <a href="https://twitter.com/MD_Driver_in_DC" target="_blank" class="link">regional lore.</a></p>
