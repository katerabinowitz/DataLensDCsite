	<p class="content">You may have noticed itâ€™s been pretty quiet around here recently. In July I headed up to New York City to be a Data Fellow at Propublica.
	<br><br> 
	I feel incredibly fortunate for the opportunity to contribute to such an excellent organization. You can see my work for them here. You should truly read everything they do. 
	<br><br>
	It is an all-around great experience, but I do miss D.C. I look forward to moving back and further DataLens-ing in 2018.
