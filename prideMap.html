    <p class="content">Washington, D.C. has at times been called one of the “gayest places in America.” (1) It is home to one of the largest pride celebrations and has a long LGBT history. Below maps out the places and spaces important to the LGBT in D.C. over more than 50 years. The data is available through The Rainbow History Project’s Places and Spaces Database, which continues to accepts recommendations of key locations.</p>
