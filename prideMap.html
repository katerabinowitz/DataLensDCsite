    <p class="content">Washington, D.C. is home to one of the largest pride celebrations in the country. Started in 1975, what's now referred to as Capital Pride is just one piece of a larger LGBT movement in D.C. over the past six decades that sought, and continues to seek, equal treatment and acceptance. Bars, bookstores, group homes, clinics and churches across the District played an essential role in providing safe spaces to a community facing discrimination as it fought for its rights. 
    <br><br>
    Below maps the places and spaces important to the LGBT community in D.C. over more than 50 years. The data is available through <a href="http://rainbowhistory.org/" class="link" target="_blank">The Rainbow History Project</a>, an organization dedicated to collecting, preserving, and promoting LGBT history in D.C.</p>
