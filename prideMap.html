    <p class="content">Washington, D.C. has at times been called one of the gayest places in America. It is home to one of the largest pride celebrations and has a long LGBT history. Below maps the places and spaces important to the LGBT in D.C. over more than 50 years. The data is available through <a href="http://rainbowhistory.org/?page_id=28" class="link" target="_blank">The Rainbow History Project’s Places and Spaces Database</a>, which continues to accept recommendations of key locations.</p>
