		  <p class='content'> DataLensDC uses open-source data and applications to present readers with insight into the District's character, trends and hacks. There’s an incredible amount of rich data freely available about the District, it’s people and places. DataLensDC distills, visualizes and contextualizes this data to give readers a deeper understanding of the District and navigating life in it. <br><br> Oh, and hi! I’m Kate, lover of all things data and District. I started this website to experiment with different coding languages and share some cool findings along the way. In the months to come you can expect topics ranging from just how local DC food gets, who moves here, segregation and the most house-flipped neighborhoods.<br><br>
