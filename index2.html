Thousands of fire code violations led to temporary closings. A GAO report found over 70% of DC public schools had inadequate features, such as windows and heating. All had asbestos, many lead paint.
    <br><br>
    Since then the District has spent billions of dollars restoring and modernizing its schools, some to <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.perkinseastman.com/project_3405944_dunbar_high_school">award-winning levels.</a> But much of that investment has been opaque.

    <h3> Kate Rabinowitz // March 17, 2016 // as featured in Washingtonian</h3>
    <p class="content"> Metro's 29 hour shutdown led to an <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2016/03/16/metro-shutdown-leads-to-record-day-for-uber-company-says/">Uber boom</a>, with a 70 percent increase over the previous week in people signing up for the app as the shutdown drew near. While many worried about sky-high fares, they rarely materialized due to a combination of ride-splitting (the company <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://newsroom.uber.com/us-dc/trips-by-the-numbers-commuting-during-the-metro-closure/">expanded its UberPool ride-sharing platform</a> to cover the entire region, not just DC), more drivers on the road, and many people in the area just staying home. Uber’s policy of “surge pricing” is, at this point, as ubiquitous as the company itself. The car-hailing service increases its rates when demand for rides outpaces the number of available drivers. In theory, this surge in pricing should encourage more Uber drivers to get on the road bringing prices closer to the standard rate.<br><br>New data show in practice where, when, and how much price surging occurs throughout the District.

    <h3> Kate Rabinowitz // January 12, 2016 // as featured in Washingtonian</h3>
    <p class='content'>Few aspects of DC’s drinking and dining scenes have changed as much in the past five years as beer production. Local breweries were sparse when I first moved to the District. But that started changing in 2011 with the founding of companies like DC Brau, the first DC-based brewery in over 50 years, and Port City Brewing Company, the Alexandria’s first production brewery since Prohibition. Since then, microbreweries and brewpubs have proliferated across the region, just as they have across the rest of the United States. There were 4,144 breweries operating nationwide at the end of 2015 according to the Brewers Association, nearly three times as many as there were in 2008. But how does Washington’s brew scene compare to other metropolitan areas?</p>

The average delay has remained at roughly 8 minutes, while the number of delays has increased over 82% compared to 2013. Metro's new general manager, Paul Wiedefeld, will certainly have his hands full. But Wiedefeld may be starting at just the right time. After particularly terrible service in the winter and early summer, Metro delays have been on decline since August.

    <p class="content">Each year, on a weekday without rain sometime between May and July a person stands at the exact same spot from 6am to 10am and again from 3pm to 7pm. They’ve been sent by D.C. Department of Transportation, and they count bikers. In my six years in the District I’ve seen the rapid rise of biking from niche transport to a commonplace commuting option. DDOT’s bike counters put numbers behind that change. The number of bikers may vary on any given day, but when looked at over time it can illuminate how bike ridership has changed across time and geography in the District.<br><br>These counts show that bike ridership has more than doubled from 2008 to 2014. But growth isn't the same across the city. The map below shows the thirty-seven DDOT bike count locations, colored by the number of riders counted in the eight-hour time period. Click on a location to see how ridership has changed over time and how it compares to the median of all count locations.</p>
