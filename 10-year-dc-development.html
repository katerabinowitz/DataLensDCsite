<h2><a href='./10-year-dc-development.html'>DC to Add Over 15 Million Square Feet in the Next 10 Years</a></h2>
    <hr id='top-line'>
    <h3> Kate Rabinowitz // August 19, 2015</h3>
    <p class='content'>Cranes and holes the size of city blocks are not uncommon sights in the District. I remember not too long ago waiting in a large downtown parking lot for a Megabus. That's now CityCenter, where a Louis Vuitton just opened. DC has experienced rapid development in recent years, which is only set to continue in the next ten. The Office of Deputy Mayor's Planning and Economic Development (DMPED) executes the Mayor's economic development strategy including real estate development. Over the next ten years through DMPED the city will add over 15 million square feet of real estate to the market. Where is it going?</p>

  <p class='content'> Ward 3 is the only one untouched by DMPED's plan, unsurprising as it is the wealthiest ward. Ward 6 stands to gain the most real estate in the next ten years, buoyed by big  projects like the <a class="link" href="http://www.hineschool.com/" target="_blank">former Hines School</a>, the <a class="link" href="http://www.swtlqtc.com/p/southwest-waterfront-redevelopment.html" target="_blank">Waterfront</a> and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.capitolcrossingdc.com/#tutorial" target="_blank"> Capital Crossing </a> over I-395. Limited development east of the Anacostia, the poorest area of the city, occurs in short term. In the 2020's Ward 8 will see a swath of new real estate driven by the renovation of <a class="link" href="http://stelizabethseast.com/" target="_blank">St. Elizabeth's East Campus</a> and <a class="link" href="http://wamu.org/programs/metro_connection/15/04/10/what_does_the_future_hold_for_the_residents_of_barrys_farm" target="_blank">controversial</a> plans at <a class="link" href="http://dcnewcommunities.org/community/barry-farm" target="_blank">Barry's Farm</a>. While much of the 15 million square feet being brought to the market is residential, not all of it is.</p>

    <p class='content'>Over half of new developments will be residential, many of which will offer much-needed affordable housing units. Developments east of the Anacostia are the most residential-focused, making up over 88% of new development. Ward 2 development is the least focused on new residential space and instead will see big gains in hotels. The greatest addition of office space will take place in Wards 5 and 6. Ward 6 is the only ward to see square footage gains across all categories, speaking to the diversity of the ward which spans Chinatown, Waterfront and Capitol Hill. The diversity of developments happening across the city in the next 10 years will undoubtedly bring change, and with any luck some cheaper rent too.<br><br> Interested in learning more about or tracking progress on these large development projects?
